# Impacts of COVID-19 on Brazilian federal highways.

This repository was made to store all the files needed for a project that aims to model the real impacts of COVID-19 to the main Brazilian federal highways.

Two datasets were used for this project.

-   Timeline of Brazil’s GPD, which can be found at [DataSebrae](https://datasebrae.com.br/pib/?pagina=evolucao-do-pib&ano=1990);
-   Federal highway toll plazas revenue, which can be found at [ANTT](https://dados.antt.gov.br/dataset/receita-pedagio);

The project was made during a class called **Transport Modeling Techniques** at Universidade Federal de Goiás (UFG).
